# AN19-onl
This is a repository where you can publish your homework
# Basic rules
- You should put your files onto a directory named after you, and store it in a standalone branch
- Don't touch the branches of other students and not mess them up unless you have theirs permission
- Be VERY careful with force push, remember that you're not the only one who's using this repository
- Master branch is a teacher's branch, don't touch it unless you're told to
- Don't merge pull requests even if you're done with your homework, teacher is responsible for transfering it to master
